In number, you choose any number between 0 and 9999. Your bet will have different payouts based on whether the number you bet is one, ten, one hundred or one thousand. If the number you bet falls on any of the 5 draws, you win!\nThe other 3 ways to bet are based on the table of animals that you can see below. The animal is based on the ten of the numbers drawn, so what counts are only the last 2 numbers of each draw. The animal bet is the simplest, if the animal you chose falls into one of the 5 draws, you win! Next, you choose two animals. These animals must land in sequence in any of the draws. They don't need to be right after (for example, draw 1 and draw 2), they just need to be in sequence (for example, draw 2 and draw 5). Finally, the quinine! To win the corner, you must say the animals that will be drawn in all 5 rounds. The order doesn't matter on the corner, you just have to hit the 5 animals (there may be repetitions).\n\n**TABLE OF ANIMALS**\n\n{{table}}",
