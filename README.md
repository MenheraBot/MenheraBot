## Self-host

You can download the files from Menhera to host it in your own bot! But for that we need to be careful!
Menhera uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org), you must have it on your machine first of all!
It also has a configuration file, which must be attached to the file **index.js**, and should be called **config.json**
The model of config.json is as follows:

```json
"prefix": "m!", //Put your bot prefix here
"token": "super_secret_token_owo", //Put your Discord Bot token here
"owner": ["15465165651052"], //Put every owner of the bot here, separated with commas
"uri": "https://akjsdnsandsanjdnsadj", //MongoDB conection url
"dbt": "Top.ggToken_uwu" //Top.gg API token
```

- Your bot's token you can get on [Discords's Site](https://discord.com/developers)
- You can access the DataBase url on [MongoDB's Site](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
- For your top.gg token, first your bot needs to be in [top.gg](https://top.gg/)

That's it! With this configuration file, you should already be able to host your bot with the Menhera's code

> Amazing, isn't it?
