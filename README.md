 ## Self-host
 You can download the files from Menhera to host it in your own bot! But for that we need to be careful!
 Menhera uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org), you must have it on your machine first of all!
 It also has a configuration file, which must be attached to the file **index.js**, and should be called **config.json**
 The model of config.json is as follows:
 ```json
 "prefix": "m!", //Put your bot prefix here
 "token": "super_secret_token_owo", //Put your Discord Bot token here
 "owner": ["15465165651052"], //Put every owner of the bot here, separated with commas
 "uri": "https://akjsdnsandsanjdnsadj", //MongoDB conection url
 "dbt": "Top.ggToken_uwu" //Top.gg API token
 ``` 

* Your bot's token you can get on [Discords's Site](https://discord.com/developers)    
* You can access the DataBase url on [MongoDB's Site](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
* For your top.gg token, first your bot needs to be in [top.gg](https://top.gg/)

That's it! With this configuration file, you should already be able to host your bot with the Menhera's code
> Amazing, isn't it?
