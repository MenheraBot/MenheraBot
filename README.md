## 👨‍💻 | Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. If you have any ideia, want to implement a new feature, fix some bug, or even improve the code itself, you can do it openning a pull request to the `feat/development` branch. Check the next session about running the project.

## 🔥 | Running

This monorepo is divided in 3 main packages. The REST takes care of making contact with Discord's API, with this, we can avoid rate limits before making the request to the API. The Gateway makes the bridge between the events process and the Discord gateway with shards. Last but not least, is the Events pacakge, which takes care of processing every interaction made by users. To run the bot, just follow the steps:

1. 🧹 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MenheraBot/MenheraBot.git
```

2. 💻 Populate the env files. 
> Every package has a .env.example file with every entry needed. Just create a .env file with all the entries.

3. 🔥 Install deps and build all the packages

```bash
yarn install && yarn build:all
```

4. 🏃‍♂️ Running all services

> Open 3 terminals and execute each command in a different one. YOU NEED TO START THE PROCESS IN ORDER REST -> GATEWAY -> EVENTS

```bash
yarn rest dev
yarn gateway dev:nomicroservices
yarn events dev:nomicroservices
```

5. 🐦 Running tests

```bash
yarn test
```
