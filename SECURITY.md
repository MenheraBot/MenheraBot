## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability it's specific like a problem with misleading translation/text, it can be made at my [Support Server](https://discord.gg/fZMdQbA) at [bug-report](https://discord.com/channels/717061688460967988/730906866896470097) channel. In a command related to anything but economy-breaking, it can be made with an Bug Issue. If the problem is related to some breaking bug to the economy system, it can also be made in Bug Report here in GitGub, BUT the `steps to reproduce` CANNOT BE DESCRIBE HERE. You need to describe it on the support server, mentioning Luxanna#5757 (<@435228312214962204>)
